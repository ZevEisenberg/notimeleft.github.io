    <h1>Paint with the awesome power of your voice!</h1>
    <p>SongBrush is an iOS app for iPhones and iPads running iOS version 10.3 and upward, that lets you paint waveform brushstrokes whose colors match to the pitch of audio data! </p>
    <p>Whether the audio stream is from your voice or from a song in your music library, SongBrush uses the power of AudioKit, an open source audio signal processing library, to detect the pitch and volume of the audio data.</p>
    <p>Your data is then translated into waveforms whose colors are generated from that data! You can paint using the brush and share your artwork with your friends or save it onto your device. SongBrush also lets you capture a few frames of your brush strokes to make a video.</p>
