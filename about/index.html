			<p>Code. Design. Create. Climb. I'm really interested in forming a connection with technology, and it is totally a cliche and a buzzword-y turn of phrase to say this but I believe that someday apps will make us better artists, scientists, cooks, writers, and runners. What else matters in life?!</p>
      <p>Hmm. These days I'm learning apple's UIKit and iOS frameworks, and iterating obsessively over my current app, SongBrush. I graduated from Brandeis last year with an M.A in computer science and took about a year to decide what to do with my life. I decided...that I should follow my wildest dreams, and get a boring 9-5 office development job while illustrating comics and exploring creative writing in my spare time. Then I discovered Swift and I latched onto the notion that software can create a relationship between user and machine, and here I am!</p>
